## 1 The Point of the Game
The game ends when you can no longer play the game, or at the ending agreed upon by the players, whichever comes first. At the end of the game, the player with the lowest number of points is The Supreme Ruler, and the player with the highest number of points is The Ultimate Scrub.

## 2 The Values
Each card has a point value. Numbered cards are worth 5 points, and special cards are worth 10 points. At the end of the round, each player gains a number of points equal to the sum of the values of all the cards left in their hand.

## 3 The King
The player that ends the round is declared The King. The King wears The Crown. The King starts the next round.

## 4 The Scrub
At the end of the round, the player that gained the most points that round is the Scrub. The Scrub is responsible for shuffling the cards, and must honor The King with all their actions. When dealing, The King is served first. The cards are placed such that The King can read the text "Uno" without discomfort, with the starting card placed for Them to the side of Their preference.

## 5 The King's Court
Every time the highest player point total crosses the next 100 point threshold, all players except The King rise from their seats. The players, excluding The King, reseat themselves according to point totals, in ascending order from the left of The King. If the Scrub is tied in points with any other players, the Scrub is considered to have a higher number of points. When all players are seated in proper relation to The King, The King's Court is declared _In Order_, and play continues with the next round.

## I Have N Cards
_This rule is yet to be documented_

## The Coup
_This rule is yet to be documented._

## Civil Unrest
If a majority of the players disagree with The Tyrant's new rule, The Court is in a state of civil unrest.

## The Tyrant's Rule
When the King emerges victorious from a coup, the King becomes the Tyrant. The Tyrant declares a new rule, which lasts the duration of the Tyrant's reign.

### Suggested Tyrant Rules

#### The Zero
When a zero is played, the next player must play their hand exposed until hands are shuffled or the round ends unless, they play a zero or special card in response.

#### Punishment
When a player wins using the _I Have N Cards_ rule, the player who placed the card of the total earns double points for that round.
